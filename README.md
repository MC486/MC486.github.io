# AI Word Strategy Game

A turn-based word-building game where players compete against AI opponents trained on real dictionary data and evolving gameplay patterns. Developed as a capstone enhancement project to demonstrate software design, AI integration, and long-term extensibility.

---

##  Features

###  Core Game
- Strategic word creation using shared and private letter pools
- Dynamic scoring system with:
  - Word length bonuses
  - Letter rarity multipliers
  - Repeat-word fatigue penalties
- Clean CLI interface for fast-paced turn-based play
- Real-time word validation using Trie-backed dictionary

###  AI Opponents
- Multiple AI models:
  - **Q-Learning** – Reinforcement agent learns long-term reward patterns
  - **Naive Bayes** – Predicts player words using letter-based probabilities
  - **Markov Chain** – Generates plausible letter transitions
  - **Monte Carlo Tree Search** – Simulates possible move sequences
- Weighted ensemble prediction with model selection via Q-learning
- Adaptive behavior based on opponent style

###  Database Integration
- SQLite-based persistent storage
- Player profile and scoring history
- AI model training data persistence
- Performance analytics and leaderboards

###  Technical Highlights
- Modular game engine architecture
- Fully tested game loop, state, input, scoring, and letter generation
- `config.yaml` for tunable gameplay settings
- Structured logs for debugging and gameplay review
- Clean Git branching and feature isolation per enhancement

##  Testing

Run the full test suite:

```
pytest
```

All modules are tested including game state handling, letter generation logic, scoring algorithms, input parsing, AI models, and database operations.

##  Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Letter pool size and distribution
- Scoring rules and fatigue settings
- AI prediction time budget (for MCTS)
- Logging verbosity and format
- Database connection parameters
